i graduated university of minnesota with bachelors in computer science, currently working as a software engineer at
vmware. recently, been working building cloud apps, but using this blog to branch out using nextjs / server side rendering.

outside of work, i have always enjoyed working on various programming projects. i also love to travel, cook, and cuddle with our two dogs.
i'm not taking this very seriously, so don't either :)
